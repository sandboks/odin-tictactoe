# PREVIEW
Screenshots for mobile and desktop coming soon, upon the project's completion!

# OVERVIEW
- Created for the Odin Project's [Tic Tac Toe assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe)
- As part of the assignment, the javascript code uses the Factory Pattern to create "private" functions and variables, with "as little global code as possible"

# FEATURES
- Play Tic Tac Toe!
- Customize each player, including their avatar, name and color
- Play against an AI-controlled CPU, or pit two of them against each other!
- Responsive layout that's fully playable across different devices

# RETROSPECTIVE
- While the basic game was completed within a day, I spent much, much longer polishing the visuals and UX, and adding extra features
- My goal was to create the absolute best game I could possibly make, with my current skillset and knowledge
- ... even if that game was something as basic as Tic Tac Toe
- There are many things I attempted in previous projects that this one does significantly better

# NEW SKILLS ACQUIRED
- @media rules
- javascript design patterns
- SVG color manipulation
- css masking properties
- 'cqmin' units
- 'Promise' and 'resolve' keywords to create pauses
- blocking mouse input with an invisible overlay

# TODO
- find a better way to make artifical wait pauses
